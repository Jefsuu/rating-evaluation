The price tag alone felt like a stretch for what the sofa offers—it's far more expensive than comparable models from other brands.

The delivery was delayed by almost a month, and when it finally arrived the packaging was damaged, which made me question the quality control.
Once I unpacked it, the unit was heavy and awkward to move, and the remote control was unresponsive right out of the box.

Philips M-8000,MICROWAVE,Long,Negative,['Product appearance' 'Delivery' 'Functionality'],"I was excited to try the Philips M-8000, but the experience was a nightmare from the start. The delivery was delayed by a week, and when it finally arrived the packaging was torn and the unit looked like it had been dropped in a warehouse. Even after cleaning the surface, the stainless‑steel finish had deep scratches that made it look cheap and poorly manufactured. Inside, the microwave barely heats anything; a 30‑minute reheating of a frozen pizza took longer than the oven in my apartment. I ended up giving up on it after a week of frustration and a very disappointing performance.

IKEA T-200,TABLE,Long,Negative,['Delivery' 'Delivery' 'Functionality'],"I ordered the IKEA T-200 table hoping it would be a quick upgrade for my dining room, but the delivery experience was a nightmare.
The package arrived two weeks late, and when it finally did, the cardboard had been crushed, leaving visible dents that made me doubt the table’s sturdiness.
Even after unpacking, I found the legs were not properly aligned, and the screws were missing, so I had to improvise with a spare screw from another piece of furniture.
The table’s surface is uneven, causing my plates to wobble, and the joints feel flimsy, which is unacceptable for a piece marketed as a solid table.
Overall, the delivery delays and poor construction make this product a huge disappointment.",1

Herman Miller W-1900,WARDROBE,Long,Negative,['Price' 'Delivery'],"Honestly, I was excited about the Herman Miller W-1900, but the price alone made me think twice.
The cost was outrageous compared to other wardrobes, and I felt I was paying for brand name rather than value.
To make matters worse, the delivery took over a month, and each update was vague.
When it finally arrived, the packaging was damaged and the assembly instructions were confusing.
I ended up spending extra time and money fixing minor shipping damage. Overall, this experience was frustrating and not worth the price.",1

Overall, the appearance of this air conditioner is a standout feature that makes every day feel like a stylish retreat.",5
Herman Miller S-1600,SOFA,Long,Negative,['Functionality' 'Product appearance'],"I was excited to bring home the Herman Miller S-1600, but it quickly became a disappointment. The sofa’s design looks sleek on paper, yet the cushions feel thin and the back support is almost nonexistent, making it uncomfortable for long periods. When I tried to adjust the reclining feature, it was stiff and barely moved, which defeats the whole point of a modern ergonomic sofa. The fabric, which was advertised as premium, started to show stains after just a week of normal use. Overall, the product’s appearance is misleading compared to its poor functionality, and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for comfort or durability.",2

The unpacking process was a breeze; the manufacturer’s instructions were clear and the fridge came with all the necessary accessories.
Functionally, the fridge has exceeded my expectations: the temperature control is precise, the humidity settings keep my produce crisp, and the ice maker churns out cubes in record time.
I also appreciate the quiet operation; even during the night, the compressor hums softly, which is a big plus for my apartment.

The smart thermostat integration is seamless; I can set a precise temperature from my phone and the unit automatically adjusts to maintain it, saving energy without sacrificing comfort. One of my favorite features is the whisper‑quiet fan—there’s barely any noise even on the highest setting, so I can still enjoy a movie or a conversation without distraction. Lastly, the self‑cleaning filter system keeps maintenance to a minimum, and the energy‑star rating means I’ve already seen a noticeable drop in my monthly utility bill. Overall, the KitchenAid A-1400 delivers on every functional promise I had, making it a top pick for anyone looking for reliable, efficient cooling.",5

Bosch W-6000,WASHING_MACHINE,Long,Negative,['Price' 'Delivery'],"I was excited to get the Bosch W-6000, but the delivery was a nightmare.
The courier arrived a week late, and when they finally brought it, the packaging was damaged and the machine was missing a few screws.
Even after fixing the installation, the price tag felt outrageous for the subpar service.
I expected a premium brand to offer reliable delivery, but instead I got a costly disappointment.
