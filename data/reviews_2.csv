The door latch was stiff, making it hard to open and close smoothly, which made me question the build quality.

Smeg R1-250,REFRIGERATOR,Long,Negative,['Price'],"Honestly, I was excited about the sleek design, but the price tag was a real eye‑roller.
For a unit that looks like a piece of art, the cost is way above what I'd expect for a standard fridge.
I ended up paying almost double what similar models in the market offer, and the extra expense doesn't translate into any noticeable performance boost.

The stainless steel finish looks great on paper, but the actual surface is scratched and has a faint, off‑white tint that makes it look cheap and poorly manufactured. Even more frustrating is the price—$399 for a unit that offers only basic heating functions and no advanced features, which feels like a steep overcharge for something that looks like it could be made from lower‑grade materials. The door latch feels flimsy, and the interior is not as polished as the exterior, which is a huge let‑down for a product that markets itself as high‑end. Overall, I expected a premium appliance that justifies its cost, but this microwave falls short on both aesthetics and value, leaving me feeling cheated and disappointed.",2

Functionally, it failed to complete a single wash cycle properly – the drum would stop mid-spin and the water would not drain, leaving clothes soaked and the machine smelling musty.

Even at a mid-range price point, it feels like a premium appliance – the build quality feels solid and the warranty gives extra peace of mind.

Second, the price feels inflated for what you get; the materials look cheap and the finish is uneven, so it looks like a bargain that didn't deliver.

Finally, the product appearance is underwhelming: the paint has a dull sheen and the wood grain appears inconsistent, giving it a mass-produced look rather than the high-end finish advertised.

The delivery took over three weeks, and when it finally arrived, the table was already dented and the assembly instructions were confusing.
Even after hours of trying to set it up, the adjustable legs were stiff and the surface warped under my laptop, making it unusable for long periods.
The price tag is outrageous for a product that fails to deliver basic quality and durability.
